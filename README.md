## Python - The Python Deep Learning library

Python is a dynamically typed programming language designed by Guido van Rossum. Much like the programming language Ruby, Python was designed to be easily read by programmers. Because of its large following and many libraries, Python can be implemented and used to do anything from webpages to scientific research
