# Python - The Python Deep Learning library
Python is a dynamically typed programming language designed by Guido van Rossum. Much like the programming language Ruby, Python was designed to be easily read by programmers. Because of its large following and many libraries, Python can be implemented and used to do anything from webpages to scientific research

# Jupyter Notebook Projects - Interactive Computing
The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more. The Jupyter Notebook an interactive computing framework, based on a set of open standards for interactive computing.
